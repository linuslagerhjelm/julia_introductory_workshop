"Adds a one to the provided argument"
# Implementation
add1(x::Number) = x + 1
add1(x::Array{T}) where T <: Number = x .+ 1

"Performs the division between x and why where x is numerator and y is 
denominator but returns the answer truncated to 0 decimals"
# Implementation
int_div(x::Number, y::Number)::Int64 = x รท y

"Accepts a value and an upper and lower bound, checks wether the value is within the range.
This function is lower inclusive and upper exclusive. If no lower bound is specified, 0 is assumed"
# Implementation

"Finds the largest value in the provided container using the provided function
This function assumes that the provided container contains at least one element"
# Implementation

"This function implements part of the classical problem  FizzBuzz (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz). 
Provided a number, it returns the correct string for the problem."
# Implementation

"Converts a string to an array of characters"
# Implementation
to_char_array(s::String)::Vector{Char} = [s...]

"Produces a string that consists of the provided string concattenated on itself n times.
Note that char is just a special case of a string and should be accepted as well"
# Implementation
self_concat(c, n::Int64)::String = c ^ n

"Concatenates s1, s2, ..., sn into s1s2...sn"
# Implementation
concatenate(s...)::String = join([s...])

"Returns the unique characters of the provided string as a new string, in order of occurrence"
# Implementation
uniq(s::String) = join(Set(s))

"Converts a string that uses space separator to a string that uses _ separator"
# Implementation
snake_case(s::String) = join(split(s), '_')

"Returns a map where each letter of the string as key and occurrencies in map as value"
# Implementation
function count_letters(s::String)::Dict{Char, Int64}

Hint: https://github.com/JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl"

"Finds the maximum distance between two nodes and returns a tuple containing 
the distance and the two nodes in question"
