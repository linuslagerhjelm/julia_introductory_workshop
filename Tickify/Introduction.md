# Tickify

Tickify is a new and upcoming startup that is completly new and original in many ways. Except for its name
that is completly unique and totaly not a shameless rip-off of a large music streaming service, they
have this brilliant new idea that is going to change the world.

The core business of Tickify is a ticket service that lets organizers publish tickets to their events in order to
allow users to buy said tickets. Although this may sound like just another ticket service, Tickify uses all the
latest and greatest in tech to deliver its unique twist, its system features a unique Machine Learning solution
that will find the best possible tickets optimized on various criteria such as prize and quality. In future releases
all ticket transactions will also be added to the block chain and the tickets can also (for an additional fee)
be delivered as a VR copy instead of just your regular boring PDF copy.

Anyway, this ticket matching system that is supposedly powered by ML is just a bunch of if-statements and what not.
Or, to be quite honest, there arent realy any if statements either, neithere are there loops, variables or nothing
much realy that is needed to run a service such as the one described above. The engineers started building the
system before the owners of Tickify realized that they had to cut cost and let the engineers go as they were way to
expensive.

This is where you come in. Tickify has hired you as consultants to complete the matching functionality. All
you have to do is to make sure that all the tests are passing before the end of the sprint. Also, no preassure
but if the feature is not complete on time, the firm will go bankrupt, which would be a great loss to the world.
